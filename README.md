# Face_Rec_Engage-22
DEPENDENCIES:
1. Python 3.x
2. cmake
3. dlib
4. numpy
5. opencv-python
6. face-recognition

DATASET:
Add the sample photos of students---whose attendance is to be taken---in the "SampleImages" folder.

ENVIRONMENT:
we have set our application in " pycharm" where i installed all the above mentioned dependencies.
 

WORKING:
when i run the source code,a web page appears which contains a button "Click To Open Camera"
 
On clicking,web cam pops up and when a face appears in it...included in "SampleImages" folder ,it identifies the person and shows his/her name on the screen.
press "Enter" to "Close Camera".
 
Simultaneusly with the identification,the attendance is recorded in Attendance.csv with proper name and time as shown below.

 


Due to "Lack of Time " I couldn't deploy my web application. so,I have prepared this file for proper understanding of "How this works".
